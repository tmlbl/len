# len

len is a command-line tool for checking if files contain lines longer than a
specified maximum length. The file patterns to check and the line length are
configurable. Provided that you have your go bin in your `PATH` the following
will work:

```
go get github.com/tmlbl/len
```

Then run `len -h` for usage.
